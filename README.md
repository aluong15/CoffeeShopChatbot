5. **Expose Local Server (Optional):**

  If you need to expose your local server using ngrok, run:

6. **Interact with the Chatbot:**

   - Use the provided endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`) to interact with the chatbot.
   - To set up fulfillment in Dialogflow:
     - Go to the [Dialogflow Console](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/).
     - Navigate to your agent and go to the **Fulfillment** section in the left-hand menu.
     - Enable the **Webhook** option and enter your ngrok or public server URL (e.g., `https://<your-ngrok-id>.ngrok.io/webhook/`).
     - Save the changes.
     - Ensure that your Dialogflow intents are configured to use this webhook for fulfillment by checking the **Fulfillment** checkbox in each intentâ€™s **Action and Parameters** section.
   - You can test the chatbot using tools like Postman or directly via a web interface if available.
